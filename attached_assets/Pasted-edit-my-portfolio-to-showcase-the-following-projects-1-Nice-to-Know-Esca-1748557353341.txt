### **Nice to Know: Escape Room Module**




**Client:** Sun Life Financial




**Tool Used:** Articulate Storyline 360




**Role:** Instructional Designer




**Project Type:** Self-paced E-learning / Gamified Learning




**Date:** March 2025




### **Project Overview**




This module was part of the *GB Admin Life Plan* curriculum designed for experienced Plan Specialists. Rather than reiterating core knowledge, it provided **additional context, updates, and historical insights**—packaged in a fun, gamified experience using an **escape room format** to boost engagement.




### **Learning Objectives**




- Deepen understanding of non-critical but relevant topics like **Paid-Up Life**, **Clarica Heritage**, and **non-coded Phoenix scenarios**.
- Encourage **self-directed discovery** through puzzles and scenario-based learning.
- Reinforce key updates via **challenge-based tasks** and knowledge checks.




### **Instructional Strategies**




- **Gamification**: Learners solve puzzles to progress through different “rooms,” each representing a knowledge topic.
- **Scenario-Based Learning**: Challenges were wrapped in realistic, work-relevant scenarios.
- **Immediate Feedback**: Learners received guided feedback after each activity to reinforce correct understanding.




### **Tools & Features**




- Articulate Storyline 360 with custom triggers and branching
- Drag-and-drop activities, locked progression, and timers
- Custom avatars and themed visuals for immersion
- Final “Self Check” room with cumulative scenario challenges




### **Outcome**




The module received **positive feedback from internal SMEs and learners** for its creativity and effectiveness. It was praised for being a refreshing departure from traditional compliance-focused modules while still reinforcing critical operational context.

**Tool Used:** Articulate Storyline 360




**Role:** Instructional Designer




**Project Type:** Self-paced E-learning | Case Study Simulation




**Date:** March 2025




### **Project Overview**




This module is part of the *My New Business Options Learning Curriculum* tailored for Case Managers. It focuses on helping learners navigate **Guaranteed Insurability Benefit (GIB)** cases through **interactive case studies**, **guided decision-making**, and **realistic system simulations** using ATHENA procedures.




### **Learning Objectives**




- Understand how to identify and assess GIB requests.
- Navigate the correct procedures using PHOENIX and ATHENA systems.
- Apply judgment in nuanced scenarios using real-life case data.




### **Instructional Strategies**




- **Scenario-Based Learning:** Multiple case studies drawn from real GIB situations.
- **Guided Prompts:** Learners make decisions with immediate feedback.
- **System Simulation Walkthroughs:** Simulated screens to reinforce navigation and actions in PHOENIX.
- **Branching Logic:** Paths differ based on learner choices, allowing them to explore consequences.




### **Tools & Features**




- Articulate Storyline 360 with advanced triggers
- Custom feedback layers
- Simulated UI based on Sun Life’s PHOENIX system
- Embedded ATHENA procedure notes




### **Outcome**
